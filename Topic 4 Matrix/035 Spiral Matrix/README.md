## 🌀 Spiral Matrix 🌀

### 📋 Problem Description

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### 🌟 Examples

**Example 1:**

![](spiral1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![](spiral2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

### 🔍 Explanation

The spiral order traversal of the matrix starts from the top-left corner and moves clockwise, visiting all the elements in the matrix.

### 💡 Tips

- Use a set of pointers to keep track of the current position and direction of the spiral.
- Increment the pointers as the spiral progresses, adjusting the boundaries of the matrix accordingly.
- Repeat the process until all elements have been visited.
